All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v11.1.0

## v11.0.0

Breaking changes:

### Upgrading to Cypress v10

There's no changes to configuration options, but if your configuration looked like this pre-10

```json
{
  "stepDefinitions": [
    "cypress/integration/[filepath].{js,ts}",
    "cypress/support/step_definitions/**/*.{js,ts}"
  ]
}
```

.. then it should look like this post-10 (notice the removal of `cypress/integration`)

```json
{
  "stepDefinitions": [
    "[filepath].{js,ts}",
    "cypress/support/step_definitions/**/*.{js,ts}"
  ]
}
```

## v9.0.0

This is the point where [badeball](https://github.com/badeball)'s fork becomes the mainline and replaces [TheBrainFamily](https://github.com/TheBrainFamily)'s implementation. This implementation has been re-written from scratch in TypeScript, has more thorough test coverage and is filled with a bunch of new feature. Read more about the transfer of ownership [here](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/issues/689).
