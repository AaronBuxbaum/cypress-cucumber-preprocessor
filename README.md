# cypress-cucumber-preprocessor

This is a fork and complete re-write of [cypress-cucumber-preprocessor]. It's
not meant for the general public, although you're obviously free to try. I
generally don't provide support in any way at this point. It differs from the
original in the following ways.

 * Somewhat simpler configuration options
 * Tested differently
 * Using TypeScript
 * No support for Cucumber JSON reports
 * No support for "all.features"
 * Supports newest Gherkin syntax (IE. Rule-keword)

```
$ npm install @badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor
```

It incidentally also fixes the following issues (non-exhaustive).
